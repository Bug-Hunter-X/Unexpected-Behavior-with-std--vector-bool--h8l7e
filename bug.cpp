std::vector<bool> is a specialized container that often leads to performance issues and unexpected behavior. It doesn't store booleans as single bits, but rather as bits within a larger memory unit, resulting in inefficient memory usage and slower access times compared to other containers.  Furthermore, operations like iterators and indexing behave differently, potentially causing subtle bugs.
