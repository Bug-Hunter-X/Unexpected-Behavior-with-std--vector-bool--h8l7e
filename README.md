This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in C++: the inefficient and surprising behavior of `std::vector<bool>`. The `bug.cpp` file shows example code highlighting performance issues and unexpected results from using this container. The `bugSolution.cpp` file offers alternative solutions to efficiently store and manage boolean data in C++.  It's generally recommended to replace `std::vector<bool>` with alternatives like `std::vector<char>` (using single bits) or `std::bitset` for better performance and predictability.
